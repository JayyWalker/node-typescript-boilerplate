## Overview
As a solo developer
I want an automated infrastructure and deployment setup
So that I can efficiently manage multiple environments and deploy changes with confidence

## Core Requirements
- Set up shared infrastructure for feature branch deployments
- Configure staging and production environments
- Implement CI/CD pipeline with CircleCI
- Automate environment cleanup
- Enable zero-downtime deployments
- Configure SSL and domain management
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Define Docker strategy
- Define branching strategy

## Technical Scope

### Frontend
N/A - Infrastructure only

### API
N/A - Infrastructure only

### Database
- PostgreSQL RDS setup
- Schema isolation for feature branches
- Database access controls

### Infrastructure
- VPC Configuration
  - Shared VPC for feature branches
  - Separate VPCs for staging/production
- Compute Layer
  - EC2 instances with Docker
  - Nginx reverse proxy
  - SSL with Certbot
- DNS Management
  - Route 53 configuration
  - Subdomain automation
- Docker Configuration
  - Image building strategy
  - Container management
- Source Control
  - Feature branch workflow
  - Environment promotion strategy
- Monitoring & Logging
  - CloudWatch setup
  - Health monitoring
  - Error tracking
  - Performance monitoring

## Testing Focus
- Infrastructure deployment validation
- Health check endpoints
- Database connection verification
- SSL certificate verification
- Cleanup process verification
- Smoke tests
- Integration tests

- Required for:
  - All application features
  - All deployment processes

## Requirements
Needs:
- AWS account and credentials
- Domain name
- CircleCI account
- Docker Hub access
- SSL certificate requirements

## Future Considerations
